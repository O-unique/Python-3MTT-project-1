This contains 4 simple python Tasks: 
1. A quiz game made up of 5 questions where the users is be able to enter in answers and the final score is calculated.
2. Objective: To create a Python-based quiz game that allows users to answer 5 questions interactively and calculates their final score based on correct answers. Acceptance Criteria: The quiz contains exactly five questions. Questions and answers are stored in an easily modifiable structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries). The user can input their answers, and responses are case-insensitive. Correct answers increase the score, and incorrect answers display the correct answer. The final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

2. Number Swapping Task: Swapping two numbers in Python. Objective: Create a Python program that swaps two numbers entered by the user and displays the values before and after swapping. Acceptance Criteria: The program accepts two numbers as input from the user. The numbers are displayed before and after swapping. The program uses Pythonâ€™s tuple unpacking for swapping. Invalid input (non-numeric) is handled gracefully with an error message. The program successfully swaps the values without requiring a temporary variable.

4. 3. Prime/Armstrong/Palindrome Number Identifier Task: Write a code/logic to determine if the value entered is a Prime number, an Armstrong Number or a Palindrome number. Objective: To create a Python program that checks whether a user-entered number is a Prime number, Armstrong number, or Palindrome, and displays the results accordingly. Acceptance Criteria: The program accepts a single integer input from the user. It checks and identifies if the number is a: Prime number: A number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Armstrong number: A number equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits. Palindrome: A number that reads the same backward as forward. The program displays appropriate messages for each property satisfied by the number. If the number does not meet any criteria, a message is displayed stating so. Non-integer input is handled gracefully with an error message.
     
   5. 4. The Fibonacci Sequence Task: Generate the Fibonacci Sequence. Objective: To create a Python program that generates the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence based on user input. Acceptance Criteria: The program accepts a positive integer input (n) from the user. It generates and displays the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is calculated iteratively. If the input is zero or negative, an appropriate error message is displayed. Non-integer input is handled gracefully with an error message.
